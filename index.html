<p class="intro">This past April, New York implemented a law allowing New York City Housing Authority residents to log any maitenance problems they experience with the NYC311 hotline. Preivously, NYCHA residents could only log problems through NYCHA's Customer Contact Center. Records of these complaints are unavailable to the public and languish as work tickets in the system for months at a time. 
    </p>
    <p> 
     Under the new law, 311 is to forward all NYCHA maintenance calls they recieve to the Customer Contact Center and log all complaint calls in a public database.
     A representative of NYC311 has confirmed that 311 has forwarded over 15,325 calls to NYCHA's Customer Contact Center since January first.    
    </p>
    <p>
   As the winter months approach residents of Red Hook Houses, the largest and one of the oldest NYCHA developments, still suffer from a nontransparent system and a backlog of work orders for home repairs.
